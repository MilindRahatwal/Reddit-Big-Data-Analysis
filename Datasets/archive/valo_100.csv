Recently I spent some money in this game, and become kind of worried. After surfing in reddit, there are some other guys have similar questions or experience, I think most of them say they aren't banned bc of AHK too. Combined with my own experience I think it would be safe at least if you don't use ahk to have any interaction with the game, like use ahk rather than mouse and keyboard to send instruction to game. Maybe they can detect if a key-press command or mouse-move is sent by keyboard or ahk. 

Also I saw someone shared their toggle mic AHK script. It makes me want to share mine too if anyone need. This script also only interact with the system volume settings, so no interaction with the game by inputing something to the game process. 

Firstly you need to install 'soundvolumeview', it can easily make you adjust each windows' volume. 

Then find Valorant process. Create a shortcut to Mute/Unmute the game.

Then you can bind a key to run that shortcut. You can use your keyboard driver to run the shortcut (My driver can't run the shortcut file(.ink file) directly, so I make a .bat file to run the shortcut file, and then use driver to bind a key to run the /bat file, it also works. )

But the problem of using .bat is that, every time you use the switch,  a cmd window would pop up for a little while. If you find it annoying you can just use AHK script. Bind a hotkey to run that shortcut file. This step can be easy. 

`The key you want to use(mine is Numpad1)::` 

`Run ""D:\Your file location\Mute Switch VALORANT""` 

`return`

Then you can easily mute and unmute the game with a single press

I hope it helps. Also excuse me if my wording is not so good, English is not my native language.

I top frag basically most games I play usually, and I usually always have a positive kd ratio, and my crosshair placement is good. But this weekend, starting Friday (now it's sunday), I've been constant bottom frag and all games except one having a negative kd ratio. And it's just this weekend so far, before I was top fragging. And I think it's not even something to do with me needing a break, because I'm not allowed to play during school days anyway so I get a 5 day break no matter what and when I started playing on Friday I was excited and ready to play Valorant, but yeah I played like trash like I said. And I whiffed so many shots on easy targets too and they just turned and one tap me, and even on targets who know I'm there I still had an easy chance to kill them bc they aren't perfect either but I still whiffed and they got me. My aim is very good for my rank but not this weekend. I don't even think it's a mindset problem either bc each and every game I was ready to top frag and do well and have some fun and I wasn't tilt queuing, but I still just did bad, so idk about mindset. I used to have a 1.21 kd now its gonna way down to 1.12 which is sad bc ik I'm better than that. Now my friend told me to play unrated for some time, and reset my aim and everything, which sounds like a great idea to me, and I was thinking I'll do that and use guardian only in unrated to fix the whiffing, does this sound like a good idea? And if there's anything else that you guys think can help please help I'm ready to get back in it and do well.

To start off, I have been playing Valorant for about 2-3 years now. I stream occasionally on twitch and I play on the APAC servers. I will not lie, I am extremely interested in getting the Riot Gun Buddy. Of course, this post isn't meant to ask for it, but to discuss with everyone how SOME Riot developers are biased towards certain players.

I have many friends, females and males. So far, I have three friends who have a Riot Gun Buddy. Three must be a lot, considering the amount of Buddies they can give out. Coincidence or not, however, all three players are females, they have what people would call nowadays, a nice voice. Bonus point, they started streaming for a month and they got the buddies no questions asked. Two of them are even toxic to players just because they have the buddies(in my experience). Now for the male friends I have, we play a lot because Valorant is fun, not for the buddies but is it weird that none of us have the Riot Gun Buddy? Is this biased? You decide.

For my personal experience with Riot developers/employees, I met them three times on separate occasions. Our team was comming, bringing good vibes and positivity. This was not because we saw the Rioter or saw a buddy, we were just geniunely nice. All these teammates were very nice to each other and coincidence or not, were all males. None of us got it. Maybe they ran out of buddies, maybe they didn't prefer giving it to guys? I don't know. Is this biased?

Am I jealous? Do I want the buddy? Yes.
Am I complaining/crying for the buddy? No.

However, when it comes to healing teammates, she excels in this as the main healer of the game, giving teammates a full 100 health over the course of 5 seconds. With this in mind, I was thinking of a possible solution to making Sage’s heal a little better for herself in those certain situations where she needs the health, in exchange for the healing of her teammates.

My suggestion for the rework would be a gradual heal to herself whenever, giving her gradual health whenever you use the heal on yourself. Similar to Skye’s heal, where you have to hold the mouse button to heal her teammates around her, this could be done in a similar fashion with Sage, where her right click could be a hold on the mouse button and gradually heal herself.

The Animation:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfuMEmcz3k0&ab\_channel=VALORANT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfuMEmcz3k0&ab_channel=VALORANT)

In this REVELATION Episode 6 Cinematic, at 2:04, Sage is seen getting shot by one of the training bots and she retreats to cover, healing herself in the process. I think grabbing one arm at the forearm with the other hand type of animation could assist with this self-heal rework.

The Balance:

Now, this may seem broken but it should be seen as a scale, where it must always be balanced. Sage should be able to heal herself up to 50 health per charge, and can use it whenever she wants, similar to Skye’s heal. But as she takes health from her bar, Sage loses the heal’s strength on a heal for a teammate. For example, if Sage healed herself for 40 health, or 50% of the heal, it would take away 40% of the heal for the teammate, giving them now 60 health instead of the full 100HP.

Self-Inflicted Heal:        0   10 20 30 40 50

Heal for Teammates: 100 90 80 70 60 50

The Heal would also still have a 45 second cool down for teammates, and once Sage completely depletes the heal herself, it will also have a 45 second cool down. I think that this balances out the change in her heal, while still providing a better heal for herself.

Yeah me neither. Obviously I understand the need to balance the agent and balance the power creep but it feels like they've been going too far with it for their recent agents. The last agent that really shook up the meta was Fade over a year ago. After Fade we've just been getting weak agent after weak agent. Harbor, Gekko, don't even get me started on Deadlock, and now Iso (which I'll get to in a minute) and I think that the meta being so unaffected by new agent releases is partially why valorant is so boring now. If there's never going to be a strong alternative to Raze/jett or viper or sova, then why even waste time releasing new agents? They're gonna see some play on launch and then never be touched again.

Ok now before people get mad let me explain why I think Iso is another failure. Ik he hasn't released yet but even the pros and content creators who tried him out early can all agree on one thing: he's mid and he won't see much higher up play. I think that he just doesn't fulfill his role as a duelist without flashes, movement, or just a generally strong enough kit. His C, which is clearly meant to be his entry tool to protect his team when getting on site, isn't a strong ability. I mean the concept of a bulletproof shield is very strong, but they didn't execute it properly, making the shield too small to protect a team. The fact that you can't stop it to block off a choke point for the duration is understandable, but it's because it lacks that sort of flexibility that the ability will likely be very niche compared to something like a jett smoke which does essentially the same job. His Q is the best ability in his kit and I'd argue it's one of the top duelist abilities in general so I won't talk about it. His E, like his C, has a strong concept but it suffers from so many problems that it basically kills the use of it. It suffers from the same issue as reyna's util which is that you have to get a kill to use it but I'll look past that for now because I feel like they at least made that aspect somewhat rewarding. But when you get the kill, you shouldn't have to absolutely ruin your crosshair placement just to get a shield from one bullet. When reyna uses her dismiss, she just has to hit e without risking anything. If someone swings the iso to trade their teammate and he's caught while he's trying to shoot the orb, he's dead without question. Reyna's dismiss guarantees her safety and not for just one bullet, but for long enough for her to get ready to reengage. Also this is just a nitpick and you probably won't see this often in game, but I think it's so stupid how an enemy can actually shoot the orb before you to break it. When are you going to add the update where you can destroy soul orbs riot? Or did you kind of forget that Reyna doesn't have this for what's objectively a stronger ability? 

Lastly, his ultimate. Aesthetics and amazing visuals aside, I don't think I've seen a more useless ultimate in any game ever than the ultimate he has rn. Let's take a look at two of the other bad ults in the game shall we?

Omen - allows him to reposition anywhere he wants and play mindgames with his opponent.

Cypher - allows his whole team to get the positions of enemies. Although the info isn't much, it can be clutch when an enemy is lurking or about to flank your team and in a 1v1 situation, knowing where they are can be key.

Although the ults above are bad, they both have one thing in common: they both give you an advantage in winning the round. Do I even have to talk about how bad a 1v1 ult is without any advantage or any reward is? The ulting Iso having the second shield in the 1v1 isn't an advantage for whoever was about to comment that. If you're hiding behind one of the two shields, you won't be able to see if the enemy just wideswings you. And if you arent hiding behind the shields, then how would that be considered an advantage in the first place? If the enemy just headshots you and wins, what was the point of all 7 ult points? Just to die without any effect on the round outcome? It's not even like the enemy keeps the damage you dealt, they're just reset to the health they had before you challenged them. If you ult someone and lose, you turn the round into a 4v5 without any effect. If you win the round, you turn it into a 4v5 at the cost of 7 ult points that you didn't even need.

I understand Riot having to release agents to appease the casual, unrated side of valorant but I'm a comp player who enjoys the dopamine rush of hitting a new rank and I'm tired of the same meta for idek how long it's been anymore. When do the comp players get a new agent that shakes up the meta? The unranked players got harbor, deadlock, gekko, and now you're going to tell me they're getting Iso as well?

In League the remake function is used to 'remake' a game when there is an afk player at the start.

I have had well over 15 ranked games now, where one of my teammates never connects, so is afk from the start, but the function hasn't worked in a single game.

Did they turn the remake function off? The command seems to exist but hasn't worked in over 15+ games where we had an afk from the start that never connects.

Malaysian agent specifically from penang, works as a comic artist.
An avid fan of horror comic books, the first light granted him powers to commune with souls, he gets inspiration from them for drawing comics.

Haunt status: basically nearsighted, but players cannot distinguish friend from foe

If he is a Controller:

C: Dome of haunting, 2 charges, 200 creds, ball of smoke that applies haunt for 2.5 seconds if you stay in there for over 5 seconds

Q: Haunting spirit, 1 charge, 300 creds, Hantu sends forward a vengeful soul that applies haunt for 2 seconds to anyone in the aoe

E: Ghastly wall, rechargeable, 1 charge, Hantu creates a wall of misty light grey smoke. Starting from 5m away, the wall will become more and more translucent until 70% opacity, and other players will see the outline of this player, up to 30% opacity depending on how close they are

X: Haunted grounds, 8 points, Hantu creates a misty area plagued with vengeful souls. All other players within the aoe are affected by haunt.


If he is Intiator

C: Ghostly projection, 1 charge, 200 creds, Hantu uses a part of his soul to create an entity modled after him or one of his teammates. He can use it to scout and area, but is limited to 20m vision. The first enemy to shoot is is affected by haunt for 1.5 seconds

Q: Ghastly light, 2 charges, 200 creds, Hantu summons a concentrated ball of self-conscious souls, seeking out anyone looking directly at them and haunting them for 2.5 seconds. (Basically a flash)

E: Soul seeker, rechargeable, Hantu calls upon a friendly soul to seek out nearby enemies in an aoe, haunting them for 2 seconds, and communicating to hantu the number of enemies in the area. (Same area as kayo knife)

X: Possession, 8 points, Hantu sends part of his soul to occupy any dead body. The controlled player has 50hp. If hantu is killed while controlling the body, the rest of his soul is transfered to the new host, healing it by 50hp and gaining Hantu's abilities.

I know Riot probably will never even glance at this but I think an agent that can actually communicate with souls would be great to expand the lore of multiple agents or places (ie what soul sage is actually inserting, who omen was or how his powers work/what progress scientists made in fracture/yoru's ancestors)",False,False,VALORANT,Agent Concept: Hantu,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/17d5x81/agent_concept_hantu/

I just played with a gold sage who talked shit in all the whole game and would not stop back-seating. Like throughout the whole game he was instructing people on what precise moves my teammates should've been making with each and every piece of util. 

on top of that, he was playing only sheriff. I added him to ask him why, and he said he only plays twice a month and doesn't care about Valorant. I thought that was a little odd since he was quite mechanically adept, so I asked if he played CSGO, which is how I know his (alleged) rank. He claimed he does just as much back-seating in that game.

I was under the impression that telling someone constantly how to use their util is ultimately harmful as not only are they going to be under more pressure, but they also probably know how to play whatever agent they're playing better than you do.

Is this an inaccurate assessment? Is frequent back-seating a valid strategy in CSGO? any there any other players that are as high elo as this fellow claimed to be that also think this is a good idea? If I'm just stupid and this is perfectly logical that's perfectly fine, I'm just trying to understand.",False,False,VALORANT,LEM CSGO player backseated the whole game...,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/17cthh4/lem_csgo_player_backseated_the_whole_game/
