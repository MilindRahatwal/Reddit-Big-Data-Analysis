Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

Twitter issued a temporary suspension earlier this week following the events taking place at the US Capitol and required the removal of three specific tweets before the account would be eligible for reinstatement. Prior to this, President Trump used Twitter to announce policy positions and campaign decisions.

The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from cancer.
Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump were expected to appeal the ruling from Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court. The president’s could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a 75-page ruling, Judge Marrero said called president’s argument ""repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values."" Presidents, their families and businesses are not above the law, the judge ruled.

In response, the President's lawyers filed an emergency notice of appeal to the 2nd circuit. 


## UPDATE:

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Donald Trump a temporary administrative stay pending expedited review by a panel of the Court.

As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!

I am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. 

Mainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. 

I support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. 

As the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.

I also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. 

I helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. 

My nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:

* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country

* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country

* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years

* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby

* Serving as program coordinator for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom

* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan

* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance
Founding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.

* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. 

* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. 

I am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy.

Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

A senior Democratic aide said the likely plan is for the House to return on Saturday.

In a letter to lawmakers, Pelosi said the House would vote on legislation to prohibit the Postal Service from implementing any changes to services it had in place on Jan. 1, 2020. Democrats have accused President Donald Trump of trying to hamstring the cash-strapped Postal Service to suppress mail-in voting.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)
