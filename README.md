# Reddit-Big-Data-Analysis
The rapid growth of social media platforms
has led to an unprecedented growth of user-generated
content, creating a vast and valuable source of data for
analysis. Analysis of such data can give insight into the
various trends and patterns not visible before. Reddit is
a popular social media platform and online community
where users can submit content, engage in discussions, and
vote on posts and comments. It is known for its diverse
range of sub-forums, called subreddits, each dedicated to a
vast spectrum of interests and topics. This project focuses
on extracting data from Reddit using the Reddit API to
create our own specified dataset to perform Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA) & visualizations. The purpose of
this analysis is to gain an understanding of how various
factors affected the community and gain valuable insights
on the findings to generate conclusive results from content
patterns.
