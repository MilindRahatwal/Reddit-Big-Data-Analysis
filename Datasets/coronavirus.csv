I’m joined remotely today by [Dr. Trevor Mundel](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Executive-Leadership-Team/Trevor-Mundel), who leads the Gates Foundation’s global health work, and [Dr. Niranjan Bose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niranjan-bose-014b00/), my chief scientific adviser.

Ask us anything about COVID-19 specifically or epidemics and pandemics more generally.
